# Sample Code

In order to show how I understand statistical theories and machine learning argolithms, I applied knowledge to analyse some data sets and also coded some argolithms from textbooks. 

##Machine learning algorighms
In order to understand theoritically and be able to use knowledge practically, Algorithms were coded from scratch with Python(Pandas, Scipy, Numpy) and figures on the texbook are reproduced from understanding of equations.
Algorithms comes from following book. The numbering indicate the capter number of the book.
