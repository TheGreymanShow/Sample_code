# Sample Code

In order to show how I understand statistical theories and machine learning argolithms, I applied knowledge to analyse some data sets and also coded some argolithms from textbooks. 

##Machine learning algorighms
In order to understand theoritically and be able to use knowledge practically, Algorithms were coded from scratch.
Algorithms comes from following book.
